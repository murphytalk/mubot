# mubot

A Slack bot that looks up an online English dictionay and add findings to an Anki Sync server, described [here](http://murphytalk.github.io/posts/2016/06/22/chatops-with-hubot-anki-automation/#.XHvNiaORV1M) .

This has been deprecated and replaced by my new [implementation written in Python](https://github.com/murphytalk/slack-bot) - yes I hate node.js and its ecosystem with a passion, and wasting half of the Internet traffic on `npm update` simply is not worth it.
