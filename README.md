# mubot

A Slack bot that looks up an online English dictionay and add findings to an Anki Sync server, described [here](http://murphytalk.github.io/posts/2016/06/22/chatops-with-hubot-anki-automation/#.XHvNiaORV1M) 

This has been deprecated and replaced by my [slack bot](https://github.com/murphytalk/slack-bot), running in docker container.
